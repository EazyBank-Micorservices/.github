Welcome to the Eazy Bank Microservices project! This project employs a microservices architecture for scalable and modular banking services.

## What is Microservices 💁

Microservices is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated machinery.
