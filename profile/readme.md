# Eazy Bank Microservices 🏦

Welcome to the Eazy Bank Microservices project! This project employs a microservices architecture for scalable and modular banking services.

## What is Microservices 💁

Microservices is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated machinery.

## Containerization
* Dockerfile
we need to write a dockerfile with the list of instructions which can be passed to docker server to generate a docker image based on the given instructions

disadvantages of using docker files

* you need to be an expert of docker concepts to write a docker file
* versioning

* Buildpacks
A project initiated by heroku & pivotal and now hosted by the  CNCF. it simplifies containerization since with it , we don't need to write a low-level docker file

* Google jib
jib is an opensource java tool maintained by Google for building docker images of java applications. It simplifies containerization since with it we dont need to write a low-level docker file
